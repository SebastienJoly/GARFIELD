# GARFIELD
Genetic Algorithm Resonator Fitting for Impedance ExtrapoLation and Determination

Example notebooks presenting the different resonator impedance and wake functions implemented as well as how to fit data with them can be found in the folder "examples".

### Roadmap :
* Add constraints on resonator parameters (i.e. forcing two resonator resonant frequencies to be spaced more than a certain value).
* Create a "smart bound determination" algorithm based on a peak finder and the resulting extracted peak properties.
* Study the capabilities of adaptative differential evolution algorithms to overcome the need to set a mutation constant and a crossover rate.
